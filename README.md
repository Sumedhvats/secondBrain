A personal knowledge management system designed to help you organize thoughts, notes, and information in a structured and accessible way.

## Overview

Second Brain is a digital framework that allows you to capture, organize, and retrieve information efficiently. Inspired by the concept of building a "second brain" outside your physical one, this repository serves as a template and guide for creating your own knowledge management system.

## Features

- **Seamless Note-Taking**: Capture ideas, concepts, and information quickly
- **Organized Structure**: Categorize notes using a flexible hierarchy
- **Cross-Referencing**: Connect related ideas across different categories
- **Search Functionality**: Find information quickly when you need it
- **Knowledge Synthesis**: Combine ideas to generate new insights
